# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Create a visualization on housing to see visually the increase of house prices over the last 40 years. Using the visualization, we can predict when the costs of AirBnB is lower and what features to choose or remove to lower the costs while having a great experience.

## Process
1. Download Tableau_Story.twbx and TableauPresentation PDF
2. Follow through the story while going through the Tableau PDF.

## Results
I have chosen option 2 and picked AirBnBs. I have recently stayed at an AirBnB a few months ago and was interested in learning more about it. The first three visualiations I chose were Beds vs Price, Property vs Price and Reviews vs Price. The reasonings for these 3 visualizations is that I find pricing to be very important when staying at an AirBNB because it can be quite expensive. I wanted to see what kind of features have an effect on the pricing of AirBnBs and to minimize the costs while having a good experience. The second part of the visualization, I have chosen a line graph of the prices of AirBnB. Is it increasing or decreasing over time? What month or season are the prices the lowest? The third part of the visualization, I wanted a map to see where exactly the AirBnBs are located. It is near a lake or any tourist attractions? How convenient is it? Which AirBnBs have good reviews while being low cost? The map is something I would look forward to the most when choosing an AirBnB. The fourth part of the visualization is creating a cluster on the review scores. Does the AirBnBs with low reviews have a different cost compared to the AirBnBs with the best reviews?

## Challenges 
The biggest challenges in the project is that Tableau Public crashes quite frequently and there are some bugs that doesnt allow it to be saved rarely. It has a lot of very nice features which does take some time to learn but is quite nice to use and the visualization is quite appealing.

## Future Goals
I would play more with the features and try to make it super detailed.
